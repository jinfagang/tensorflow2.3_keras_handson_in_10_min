# TensorFlow 2.3 in 10 minutes

this is the official repo for TensorFlow 2.3 series tutorial for beginners. We also released **video** tutorial codes on every project in 10 minutes. Codes will keep update here. Hope everyone can learn how to use modern TensorFlow 2.x to build your own applications. As the pave of AI is getting more faster, fundamental things like building model more faster is essentially a basic skill or ML careers.

We are going go though 6 projects to make every one hands on new TensorFlow usage.

- [ ] image classification (with more than 6 backbones supported);
- [ ] image segmentation;
- [ ] style transfer in realtime;
- [ ] object detection;
- [ ] text generation using BERT;
- [ ] text to speech.



## Requirements

To run all the codes, install tensorflow-gpu latest, if you doesn't posses a GPU, using CPU instead. I strongly recommanded setup enviroment using Anaconda for beginners. I have record a video to tutor how to setup deep learning environment much more faster and reliable.
